# Discord Automation


## Description

I made this automation bot to show what you can do with Pyautogui

## Future Updates

- Add ban detection
- Add a selective terminal
- Turn it into more of a selfbot so you can do other things while it is running


## Installation

- Download Python 3.11.2 [Download](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.2/python-3.11.2-amd64.exe)
- Download files or paste ```git@github.com:ProfessedRay4/Discord-automation.git``` into the git terminal
- On either Virtural Fisher or AutoRPG, run the Start.bat file
